# MGD_playground

This is a place for me to write some simple code that demonstrates models etc. run on the MGD data.

1. Make the singularity images from `images`

2. Prepare the data with `get-data`

3. Run the scripts with the relevant image!
The naming should be self-explanatory (`bioc.sif` is for all of the R code). 
They should all work now, like some sort of container-based magic trick.
